# Farofa

Farofa (Brazilian Portuguese: [fa'ɾɔfɐ]) is a toasted cassava or corn flour mixture. 
Farofa is served alongside the main course and can either be sprinkled on by individual diners to their taste before eating, 
or eaten as an accompaniment in its own right, as rice is often consumed. Besides cassava, corn flour is also used for farofa making.
In West Africa, a variant of cassava flour known as garri is used in various dishes.
