# Farofa

## Ingredients

 - Toasted cassava flour (Farinha de mandioca torrada)
   - Note that it has to be _toasted_. The raw flour cannot be used for this recipe. 
   - This is easy to find in latin markets, but is also available [on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TXP2M7W/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
