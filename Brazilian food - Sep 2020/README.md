# Brazil Edition

Presented by @LeonardoViotti on

Brazilian cusine is varied and rich, but often takes specific ingredients not so easily found in the US. For this session we made an effort to select a very traditional and delicous dishes that can be made with ingredients commonly found in (fancy) supermarkets in DC. There are links for recommended ingredients from amazon.com, but the main dish can be made without them. For the side dish, if you don't want to order anything, please feel free to replace farofa with plain white rice.

## Moqueca de banana da terra

Moqueca (IPA: [moˈkɛkɐ] or IPA: [muˈkɛkɐ] depending on the dialect, also spelled muqueca) is a Brazilian seafood stew. It is slowly cooked in a terracotta cassole. Moqueca can be made with shrimp or fish as a base with tomatoes, onions, garlic, lime and coriander. The name moqueca comes from the term mu'keka in Kimbundu language (Source: Wikipedia).

This recipe is for a vegetarian of moqueca, that is also commonly served as a side dish in Bahia and Espirito Santo.

## Farofa

Farofa (Brazilian Portuguese: [fa'ɾɔfɐ]) is a toasted cassava or corn flour mixture. 
Farofa is served alongside the main course and can either be sprinkled on by individual diners to their taste before eating, 
or eaten as an accompaniment in its own right, as rice is often consumed. Besides cassava, corn flour is also used for farofa making.
In West Africa, a variant of cassava flour known as garri is used in various dishes.(Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farofa))

This recipe is a liberal adaptation (with some [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qKCZK3v1eoA) influnces).
