## Moqueca de banana da terra

Moqueca (IPA: [moˈkɛkɐ] or IPA: [muˈkɛkɐ] depending on the dialect, also spelled muqueca) is a Brazilian seafood stew. It is slowly cooked in a terracotta cassole. Moqueca can be made with shrimp or fish as a base with tomatoes, onions, garlic, lime and coriander. The name moqueca comes from the term mu'keka in Kimbundu language (Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moqueca)).

This recipe is for a vegetarian version of moqueca, that is also commonly served in Northeastern Brazil.
