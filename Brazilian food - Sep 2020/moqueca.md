## Ingredients
 - 4-5 large mature plantains.
 - 6 medium tomatoes in slices.
 - 2 medium onions in slices (or julienne).
 - 3 smashed and sliced garlic cloves.
 - 1 small red pepper in slices.
 - 1 small yellow pepper in slices.
 - 1 lemon.
 - Fresh cilantro leaves.

   - Both Jalapeño or Habanero work, depending on how spicy you like your food.
 - 1 can of coconut milk (2 cans if you really like it).
 - Palm oil (azeite de dedê). 
   Any will work but for the best taste I suggest [this one](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VGNQAWM/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_1?smid=A3B64JA11RFAS1&psc=1).
 - Olive oil.
 - Smoked paprika.
 - Salt.
 - Black pepper.

 ## KITCHEN APPLIANCES
 - Large pan, ideally with thick bottom. A clay pot is traditionally used, but a cast iron or enameled dutch oven are the second best options. 

## Preparation
1. Cut plantains in thick stripes and season with salt, garlic and lemon.
2. Pre-heat the pan and fry part (1/3 aprox.) of the onions with the sliced chilies and very thinly chopped cilantro stems in a mix of olive and palm oil.
3. Once the onions are soft, add garlic and let it fry a bit.
4. Add salt, black pepper and paprika.
5. Before the garlic burns, add a layer of plantains, tomatoes, onions and pepper. 
6. Repeat layers until the pan is full.
7. Add coconut milk.
8. Let it cook for aprox. 20min on medium heat or until vegetables are cooked. Do not stir. 
9. Add some cilantro leaves and serve.
